# Searching:
if they are on the list render the differently. there can be 2  components that render when ur searching. 1 a non group. 1 a curr group. ccomponet. if uid is in group already then render diff and maybe instead of add say remove.
 
# What is overall goal? 
-Near end of second to last sprint.
-We are not going to implement a rent implementation feature unless we have excess time. We are more or less organizing our data on dashboard. Dashboard is our last thing to finalize. In our dashboard we want to show indiviual rent and total rent for house. List housemates and maybe there rent amount. as well as shorthand links to your housemates. and maybe a trans graph of %on-time payments, or stats on whos been late.
-If owner recieves payment, then owner can have diff layout of group page.
-profile page vs dashboard. atm many similarities

# PostSprint Goals:
-add settings under profile
-change current profile page info to dashboard
-figmas for new upcoming pages ++
-change password
-update profile pic can be modules
