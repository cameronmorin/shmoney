# Shmoney

## App Description:
Shmoney is a payment platform that doubles as a social media app focused for sending/requesting money to your current roommates. You will also be able to use the app to look for other roommates. Users will be able to create a profile that lists personality traits to help them match with other potential roommates with similar traits. There will be a credibility system that is based on how responsible users have been with past payments so other people can decide if they are comfortable asking them to be roommates.
## App Description(version 2):
Shmoney is a rent organization platform that allows friends and roommates to better organize their rent payments. Users will be able to create a profile and set a profile picture and username. They can also create rent groups and add other users to their rent group in order to keep track of their household rent bills.
