# Shmoney
Shmoney is a rent organization platform that allows friends and roommates to better organize their rent payments. Users will be able to create a profile and set a profile picture and username. They can also create rent groups and add other users to their rent group in order to keep track of their household rent bills. Only group owners will have the ability to verify payments on created bills, but every group member will be able to see the groupâ€™s payment status for each other individual in the group. This will help roommates keep each other accountable on paying rent, as well as provide a convenient, organized way of viewing their rent payment history.
